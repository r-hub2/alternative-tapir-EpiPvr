Description: Provides functions for estimating plant pathogen parameters from 
    access period (AP) experiments. Separate functions are implemented for 
    semi-persistently transmitted (SPT) and persistently transmitted (PT) 
    pathogens. The common AP experiment exposes insect cohorts to infected source 
    plants, healthy test plants, and intermediate plants (for PT pathogens). The 
    package allows estimation of acquisition and inoculation rates during feeding, 
    recovery rates, and latent progression rates (for PT pathogens). Additional 
    functions support inference of epidemic risk from pathogen and local 
    parameters, and also simulate AP experiment data. The functions implement 
    probability models for epidemiological analysis, as derived in Donnelly et
    al. (2025), <doi:10.32942/X29K9P>. These models were originally 
    implemented in the EpiPv GitHub package.
